# Advent of Code - 2020

Here are my attempts at the Advent of Code 2020 challenges, all using Kotlin.

Each day's answers can be found in the `sr/main/kotlin` directory, with one Kotlin File/Class per day.

All inputs can be found in the `inputs/` directory.

As with other years, I can have attempted to use idiomatic Kotlin where possible, and have favoured functional style where I can (e.g. immutability, use of folds/reduce etc)

Unlike other years, this year I did NOT do this at Xmas time. I only started in 2021, so this was done during a holiday in 2023, hence why not all puzzles were completed.
